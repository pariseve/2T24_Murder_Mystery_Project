  description: "A document Ivy printed out regarding \u201CThe Hive\u201D. It reads:
    \n\nThe Sovereign Collective, also commonly referred to as \u201CThe Hive\u201D,
    is believed to be an organisation centred around the research and exploration
    of the human condition through unorthodox methods. Many believe this group to
    be a subsect of the Elysian Dawn, a cult who worshipped the fictitious goddess
    Nyxara, whom they refer to as \u201CMother\u201D. The cult, which was rampant
    between 1973-1981, was known to exhibit extreme views surrounding the limitations
    of human life and often partook in radical rituals that resulted in the mutilation
    of many and, in severe cases, led to death. "
